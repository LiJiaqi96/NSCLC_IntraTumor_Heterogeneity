# NSCLC Intra-tumor Heterogeneity Analysis with Image Method
*Jiaqi Li, Haiming Lu, Xiang Fang, Sijie Chen and Xuegong Zhang*

We applied pixel-level clustering and observed 3 different image patterns among nodules from 200 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients: "**uni-core**", "**multi-core**" and "**diffused**" patterns.

Here we show the complete results of all 200 patients in the unpublished paper "Pixel-Level Clustering Reveals Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer".
